* The content of the website should be saved in markdown formatted files on your computer.

* It can be a good idea to choose a relatively small website.

* It can also be a good idea to have some sort of limit on which links you want to follow.
        

* What you choose to retrieve from the crawled site is up to you. But you should describe why you choose to do
            like you did.

* It is important, that you at the exam precisely demonstrate the fulfilments of these requirements. 
* When your requirements have been approved, they can not be changed.
